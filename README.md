**Hello there!**

My name is Miranda and I'm a Computer Science student from Montreal.




- I’m interested in Web Developing projects and everything that is seemingly related to Computer Science. </br>
- I’m currently learning JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS. I learned C, Java and Python.


Current projects:
- The NosThes Bubble Tea Shop website ( Reactjs + HTML + CSS)
- An application that searches for Asian restaurants located in Montreal (React and PokeAPI)
